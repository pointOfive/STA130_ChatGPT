    "A reasonable characterization of STA130 Homework is that it simply defines a weekly reading comprehension assignment. \n",
    "Indeed, STA130 Homework essentially boils down to completing various understanding confirmation exercises oriented around coding and writing tasks.\n",
    "However, rather than reading a textbook, STA130 Homework is based on ChatBots so students can interactively follow up to clarify questions or confusion that they may still have regarding learning objective assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Communication is a fundamental skill underlying statistics and data science, so STA130 Homework based on ChatBots helps practice effective two-way communication as part of a \"realistic\" dialogue activity supporting underlying conceptual understanding building. \n",
    "\n",
    "It will likely become increasingly tempting to rely on ChatBots to \"do the work for you\". But when you find yourself frustrated with a ChatBots inability to give you the results you're looking for, this is a \"hint\" that you've become overreliant on the ChatBots. Your objective should not be to have ChatBots \"do the work for you\", but to use ChatBots to help you build your understanding so you can efficiently leverage ChatBots (and other resources) to help you work more efficiently.<br><br>\n",

    "The TUT and HW both addressed some of the assumptions used in **Simple Linear Regression**. The **p-values** provided by `statsmodels` via `smf.ols(...).fit()` depend on these assumptions, so if they are not (at least approximately) correct, the **p-values** (and any subsequent claims regarding the \"evidience against\" the **null hypothesis**) are not reliable. In light of this consideration, describe how you could diagnostically check the first three assumptions (given below) when using analyses based on **Simple Linear regression** model. From an Ethical and Professional perspective, do you think doing diagnostic checks on the assumptions of a **Simple Linear regression** model is something you can and should do whenever you're doing this kind of analysis? \n",
