    "1. **Conduct an MLR Analysis**:\n",
    "   - Select multiple predictors from the Canadian Social Connection Survey data and examine how they jointly influence an outcome variable. Pay special attention to the inclusion and interpretation of **interaction terms** and **categorical variables**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Visualize Interaction Effects**:\n",
    "   - Utilize tools like `plotly.express` to visualize how interaction terms influence the regression line. Create plots to explore how the relationship between your predictors and the outcome changes across different levels of another predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Modeling Categorical Variables with Dummy Variables**:\n",
    "   - Add categorical variables to your MLR model using dummy variables. Interpret the coefficients in relation to a baseline category, and ensure you understand why one category is omitted to avoid multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Investigate Multicollinearity**:\n",
    "   - Assess the presence of multicollinearity in your MLR model by calculating **Variance Inflation Factors (VIFs)** for each predictor. Reflect on how multicollinearity can affect the stability and interpretation of your model, and explore techniques to mitigate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hypothesis Testing with MLR**:\n",
    "   - Formulate and test a **null hypothesis** that examines the combined effect of multiple predictors on an outcome variable using MLR. Consider how interaction terms might influence your hypothesis and the interpretation of your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Explore Model Diagnostics**:\n",
    "   - Use diagnostic plots (e.g., residual plots, normality tests) to check whether the assumptions of MLR are satisfied in your analysis. Reflect on how any deviations from these assumptions might impact your findings and the reliability of your model.\n",
